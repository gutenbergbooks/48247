<h2 class="i">Preface</h2>
<p>Demand for books of prayers has caused this
book to be compiled. The experience of The
Upper Room in publishing Ralph S. Cushman&rsquo;s
<i>A Pocket Book of Prayer</i> with its sale of over
a million copies and the reaction from the
publication of other prayer books have prompted
the editor to collect and arrange these prayers.
There are prayers of our Lord, the apostles, the
martyrs, and the saints covering the period of
the Early Church from its beginning through
the fifth century. There are some prayers from
each of the first five centuries. The treasure
house from which to choose is almost unlimited.
It is a vast and fruitful field and anyone is amply
rewarded who delves into it.</p>
<p>The prayers have been selected primarily for
their spiritual and devotional content. Many
have been laid aside with regret that they
could not be included in this book, but its compass
in size is set and only so many can be
used.</p>
<p>The prayers are arranged chronologically.
Some other method of arrangement might have
been chosen but this seemed good in order to
represent each century. There are questions about
the date and authorship of the prayers. They are
the same questions that arise in reference to the
Books of the Bible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>This book of prayers is published with the
hope and prayer that it may have wide use. It
has been prepared for individual and family
devotions. It can be used with prayer groups in
prayer meetings, for cells, and, of course, for
the development of one&rsquo;s own personal spiritual
life. The material is perfect for use in the devotional
services of young people&rsquo;s groups,
women&rsquo;s groups, and men&rsquo;s clubs. The prayers
are excellent for insertion in church bulletins.
Other ways will be found of making these
great prayers usable.</p>
<p>The prayers have been collected from many
old books of prayers and devotional materials.
The editor is deeply indebted to all those who
have ploughed the field before. They have labored
and we have entered into their labors. It
has been a joy to search out the material, to arrange
the prayers, to put them in order, and to
index them under so many subjects.</p>

<h3>The Prayer of Simeon</h3>
<p>Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in
peace, according to thy word; for mine eyes
have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared
before the face of all people; a light to
lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy
people Israel.
<span class="lr">&mdash;Luke 2:29.</span></p>
<h3>The Magnificat</h3>
<p>And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the
Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my
Saviour. For he hath regarded the low estate
of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth
all generations shall call me blessed. For
he that is mighty hath done to me great things;
and holy is his name. And his mercy is on
them that fear him from generation to generation.
He hath shewed strength with his arm;
he hath scattered the proud in the imagination
of their hearts. He hath put down the mighty
from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.
He hath filled the hungry with good
things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.
He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance
of his mercy.
<span class="lr">&mdash;Luke 1:46-54.</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h3>Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane</h3>
<p>O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup
pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but
as thou wilt. O my Father, if this cup may
not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy
will be done.
<span class="lr">&mdash;Matt. 26:39, 42.</span></p>
<h3>Jesus&rsquo; High Priestly Prayer</h3>
<p>These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his
eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is
come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may
glorify thee: as thou hast given him power
over all flesh, that he should give eternal life
to as many as thou hast given him. And this
is life eternal, that they might know thee the
only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou
hast sent. I have glorified thee on the earth:
I have finished the work which thou gavest me
to do. And now, O Father, glorify thou me with
thine own self with the glory which I had with
thee before the world was. I have manifested
thy name unto the men which thou gavest me
out of the world: thine they were, and thou
gavest them me; and they have kept thy
word. Now they have known that all things
whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee. For
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
I have given unto them the words which thou
gavest me; and they have received them, and
have known surely that I came out from thee,
and they have believed that thou didst send me.
<span class="lr">&mdash;John 17:1-8.</span></p>
<h3>Jesus Prays From the Cross</h3>
<p>Father, forgive them; for they know not
what they do.
<span class="lr">&mdash;Luke 23:34.</span></p>
<p>Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit.
<span class="lr">&mdash;Luke 23:46.</span></p>
<h3>Prayer of Stephen</h3>
<p>And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God,
and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.</p>
<p>And he kneeled down, and cried with a
loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.
And when he had said this, he fell asleep.

<h3>That Christ May Dwell in Your Hearts</h3>
<p>Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith
in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,
cease not to give thanks for you, making mention
of you in my prayers; that the God of our Lord
Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto
you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
knowledge of him: the eyes of your understanding
being enlightened; that ye may know what
is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of
the glory of his inheritance in the saints, and
what is the exceeding greatness of his power to
us-ward who believe, according to the working
of his mighty power, which he wrought in
Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and
set him at his own right hand in the heavenly
places.</p>
<p>For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole
family in heaven and earth is named, that he
would grant you, according to the riches of his
glory, to be strengthened with might by his
Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell
in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted
and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend
with all saints what is the breadth, and length,
and depth, and height; and to know the love
of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye
might be filled with all the fulness of God.</p>
<p>Now unto him that is able to do exceeding
abundantly above all that we ask or think, according
to the power that worketh in us, unto
him be glory forever and ever. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>

<h3>For Friends and Relatives</h3>
<p>O God, the Father of glory, the God of our
Lord Jesus Christ, of whom every family in
heaven and earth is named, thou who hast set
the solitary in families, grant to all members of
this family and to all the members of our different
families, that, according to the riches of
thy glory, we may be strengthened with might
by thy Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may
dwell in our hearts by faith; that we, being rooted
and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend
with all saints what is the breadth, and length,

Christ, which passeth knowledge, that we may

<h3>For a Knowledge of God&rsquo;s Will</h3>
<p>O Almighty God, we are confident of this very
thing, that he which hath begun a good work in
us, will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:
we pray that our love may abound yet more and
more in knowledge and in all judgment; that we
may approve things that are excellent; that we
may be sincere and without offense, till the day
of Christ, being filled with the fruits of righteousness,
which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory
and praise of God. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>

<h3>Persecuted for Righteousness&rsquo; Sake</h3>
<p>O Lord, our heavenly Father, grant to thy children
who are persecuted for righteousness&rsquo; sake
that our conversation may be as becometh the
Gospel of Christ; that we may stand fast in one
spirit, with one mind striving together for the
faith of the Gospel; that in nothing terrified by
our adversaries we may be steadfast in behalf of
Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to
suffer for his sake, who liveth forever and ever.
<span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;<i>Adapted</i>: Philippians 1:27-29.</span></p>
<h3>For Spiritual Desires</h3>
<p>Our Father, we most humbly beseech Thee to
give unto this house, and unto each member of
it in particular, to stand fast in the Lord. May
we be of the same mind in the Lord. May we rejoice
in the Lord alway. Grant that whatsoever
things are true, whatsoever things are honest,
whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are
pure, whatsoever things are lovely, if there be
any praise, may we think on these things, may
we know both how to be abased, and how to
abound. May we do all things through Christ
which strengtheneth us, knowing that God shall
supply all our need according to his riches in
glory by Christ Jesus. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;<i>Adapted</i>: Philippians 4.</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<h3>Patience and Longsuffering</h3>
<p>For this cause we also, ... do not cease to
pray for you, and to desire that ye might be
filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom
and spiritual understanding; that ye might
walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being
fruitful in every good work and increasing in
the knowledge of God; strengthened with all
might according to his glorious power, unto all
patience and longsuffering with joyfulness; giving
thanks unto the Father, which hath made us
meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the
saints in light: who hath delivered us from the
power of darkness, and hath translated us unto
the kingdom of his dear Son: in whom we have
redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness
of sins.</p>
<p>Now unto God and our Father be glory for
ever and ever. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;<i>Adapted</i>: Epistles to the Colossians 1:9-14 and Philippians 4:20.</span></p>
<h3>Begotten to a Lively Hope</h3>
<p>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant
mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope
by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled,
and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for
us. Keep us by the power of God through faith
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
unto salvation; that the trial of our faith, being
much more precious than of gold that perisheth,
though it be tried with fire, might be found unto
praise and honour and glory at the appearing of
Jesus Christ. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>

<h3>For All Kings and Rulers</h3>
<p>Grant unto all Kings and Rulers, O Lord,
health, peace, concord, and stability, that they
may administer the government which Thou
hast given them without failure. For Thou, O
heavenly Master, King of the Ages, givest to
the sons of men glory and honour, and power
over all things that are upon the earth. Do
Thou, Lord, direct their counsel according to
that which is good and well pleasing in Thy
sight, that administering in peace and gentleness,
with godliness, the power which Thou
hast given them, they may obtain Thy favour.
O Thou Who alone art able to do these things,
and things far more exceeding good than these,
for us, we praise Thee, through the High Priest
and Guardian of our souls, Jesus Christ; through
Whom be the glory and the majesty, unto Thee,
both now and for all generations, and forever
and ever. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>

peace, the ineffable sea of love, the fountain of
blessings, and the bestower of affection, Who
sendest peace to those that receive it; open to
us this day the sea of Thy love, and water us
with the plenteous streams from the riches of
Thy grace. Make us children of quietness, and
heirs of peace. Enkindle in us the fire of Thy
love; sow in us Thy fear; strengthen our weakness
by Thy power; bind us closely to Thee and
to each other in one firm bond of unity; for the
sake of Jesus Christ. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Syrian Clementine Liturgy.</span></p>
<h3>For Rulers and Governors</h3>
<p>To our rulers and governors on the earth&mdash;to
them Thou, Lord, gavest the power of the
kingdom by Thy glorious and ineffable might,
to the end that we may know the glory and
honour given to them by Thee and be subject
to them, in nought resisting Thy will; to them,
Lord, give health, peace, concord, stability, that
they may exercise the authority given to them
without offence. For Thou, O heavenly Lord
and King eternal, givest to the sons of men
glory and honour and power over the things
that are on the earth; do Thou, Lord, direct
their counsel according to that which is good
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
and well-pleasing in Thy sight, that, devoutly
in peace and meekness exercising the power
given them by Thee, they may find Thee propitious.
O Thou, who only hast power to do
these things and more abundant good with us,
we praise Thee through the High Priest and
Guardian of our souls Jesus Christ, through
whom be glory and majesty to Thee both now
and from generation to generation and forevermore.

every soul that calleth upon His glorious and
holy Name, faith, peace, patience, long-suffering,

<h3>For Forgiveness</h3>
<p>Thou didst make to appear the enduring
fabric of the world by the works of Thy hand;
Thou, Lord, didst create the earth on which we
dwell,&mdash;Thou, who art faithful in all generations,
just in judgments, wonderful in strength
and majesty, with wisdom creating and with
understanding fixing the things which were
made, who art good among them that are being
saved and faithful among them whose
trust is in Thee; O merciful and Compassionate
One, forgive us our iniquities and offences
and transgressions and trespasses. Reckon not
every sin of Thy servants and handmaids, but
Thou wilt purify us with the purification of
Thy truth; and direct our steps that we may
walk in holiness of heart and do what is good
and well-pleasing in Thy sight and in the sight
of our rulers. Yea, Lord, make Thy face to
shine upon us for good in peace, that we may
be shielded by Thy mighty hand and delivered
from every sin by Thine uplifted arm, and
deliver us from those who hate us wrongfully.
Give concord and peace to us and all who dwell
upon the earth, even as Thou gavest to our
fathers, when they called upon Thee in faith
and truth, submissive as we are to Thine almighty
and all-excellent Name. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>

<p>O God, who art great, great in name and
counsel, powerful in Thy works, the God and
Father of Thy Holy Son Jesus, our Saviour,
look upon us, Thy flock, which Thou hast
chosen through Him to the glory of Thy Name;
sanctify us in body and soul, and grant that
we, being purified from all filthiness of flesh
and spirit, may partake of the mystic blessings
now going before Thee, and judge none of us
unworthy of them, but be Thou our Supporter,
our Helper, and Defender, through Thy Christ,
with whom glory, honour, laud, praise, thanksgiving,
be to Thee and the Holy Ghost forever.

Christ, Thine only begotten Son, give me a

<h3>Intercession</h3>
<p>May God the Father, and the Eternal High
Priest Jesus Christ, build us up in faith and
truth and love, and grant to us our portion
among the saints with all those who believe on
our Lord Jesus Christ. We pray for all saints,
for kings and rulers, for the enemies of the
Cross of Christ, and for ourselves we pray that

<h3>A Dying Prayer of Polycarp, the Martyr</h3>
<p>O Father of Thy well-beloved and blessed
Son Jesus Christ, through whom we have
known Thee; O God of the angels and powers
and of every living creature, and of all sorts
of just men which live in Thy presence, I
thank Thee that Thou hast graciously vouchsafed
this day and this hour to allot me a portion
among the number of martyrs, among the
people of Christ unto the resurrection of the
everlasting life, both of body and soul, in the
incorruption of the Holy Ghost; among whom
I shall be received in Thy sight this day, as a
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
fruitful and acceptable sacrifice, as Thou hast
heretofore prepared, often revealed and now
fulfilled, most faithful God who canst not lie.
Wherefore for all things I praise Thee, I bless
Thee, I glorify Thee, through the everlasting
High Priest, Jesus Christ, Thy well-beloved Son,
to whom with Thee and the Holy Ghost, be
all glory, world without end. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;The Martyrdom of Polycarp.</span></p>
<h3>A Prayer for the Privilege of Martyrdom</h3>
<p>Ask for me this only in your prayers, that
strength may be given me of the Lord that I
may not be called but proved to be a Christian.
Then shall I be seen to be faithful when
the world no longer sees me. For nothing that
appeareth is eternal. For the things which are
perceived are temporal, but the things which
are not seen are eternal. I write to the Churches
and charge you all that willingly I die for
Christ, if you prevent me not. I ask of you
that your love for me be not untimely; allow
me to be devoured of wild beasts, through whom
I may attain unto God. I am the grain of God
ground between the teeth of wild beasts, that
I may be found to be the pure bread of
Christ. Then indeed shall I be the true disciple
of Christ when the world shall no longer
behold my body. Beseech Christ on my behalf
that through these means I may be found a
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
perfect sacrifice. Not as Peter and Paul do I
command you. They were apostles, I am the
least of them; they were free, but I am a slave
even unto this day, but, if you wish, I shall
be the freedman of Jesus Christ, and in Him
I shall rise again and be free. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Ignatius.</span></p>
<h3>For Soul Cleansing</h3>
<p>O God, who hast taught us Thy divine and saving
oracles, enlighten the souls of us sinners for
the comprehension of the things which have
been before spoken, so that we may not only
be seen to be hearers of spiritual things, but
also doers of good deeds, striving after guileless
faith, blameless life, and pure conversation.</p>
<p>Release, pardon, and forgive, O God, all our
voluntary and involuntary sins, such as we have
committed in action and in word, knowingly
and ignorantly, by night and by day, in mind
and thought, forgive us all in goodness and
love.</p>
<p>Sanctify, O Lord, our souls, bodies and
spirits; examine our minds and search our
consciences; take from us all evil imaginations,
all impurity of thought, all inclinations to lust,
all depravity of conception, all envy, pride and
hypocrisy, all falsehood, deceit and irregular
living, all covetousness, vain glory and sloth;
all malice, anger and wrath, all remembrance of
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
injuries, all blasphemy and every motion of flesh
and spirit that is contrary to the purity of Thy
Will. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Liturgy of St. James.</span></p>
<h3>To Witness for Christ</h3>
<p>Grant, O merciful God, that as Thy holy
Apostle St. James, leaving his father and all
that he had, without delay, was obedient to
the call of Thy son Jesus Christ, and followed
Him, and at last cheerfully laid down his life
for His gospel&rsquo;s sake, so I, forsaking all worldly
and carnal affections, may be evermore ready
to follow Thy holy commandments, and, whenever
Thy providence shall make it my duty, may
readily and cheerfully embrace death, though
armed with his utmost terror, rather than forsake
or deny Thee. Let me rejoice in every
happy occasion of testifying the sincerity of
my love, by suffering for Thy truth, and let
the firm belief of those glorious eternal rewards
which Thou hast prepared for them who lay
down their lives for Thy sake, support me
under all the cruelties of the most merciless persecutors.
Grant this, O blessed Lord, who didst
die for me, and didst rise again, and now sittest
at the right hand of the Father, to intercede
for me, and all Thy faithful disciples.

hosts of holy angels and archangels; sanctify, O
Lord, our souls and bodies and spirits, search
our consciences, and cast out of us every evil
thought, every base desire, all envy and pride,
all wrath and anger, and all that is contrary
to Thy holy will. And grant us, O Lord, Lover
of men, with a pure heart and contrite soul, to
call upon Thee, our holy God and Father who
art in heaven. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Liturgy of St. James.</span></p>
<h3>Sanctify Us, O Lord</h3>
<p>God and Father of our Lord and God and
Saviour Jesus Christ, the glorious Lord, the

God and Sovereign of all, who art blessed to
all eternity, who sittest upon the cherubim, and
art glorified by the seraphim, before whom stand
thousand thousands and ten thousand times ten
thousand hosts of angels and archangels: Thou
hast accepted the gifts, offerings, and fruits
brought unto Thee as an odour of a sweet spiritual
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
smell, and hast been pleased to sanctify them,
and make them perfect, O good One, by the
grace of Thy Christ, and by the presence of
Thy all-holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Sanctify also, O Lord, our souls, and bodies,
and spirits, and touch our understandings, and
search our consciences, and cast out from us every
evil imagination, every impure feeling, every
base desire, every unbecoming thought, all envy,
and vanity, and hypocrisy, all lying, all deceit,
every worldly affection, all covetousness, all
vainglory, all indifference, all vice, all passion,
all anger, all malice, all blasphemy, every motion
of the flesh and spirit that is not in accordance
with Thy holy will: and count us worthy, O
loving Lord, with boldness, without condemnation,
in a pure heart, with a contrite spirit, with
unshamed face, with sanctified lips, to dare to
call upon Thee, the holy God, Father in heaven.
<span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Liturgy of St. James.</span></p>
<h3>For Stewardship</h3>
<p>O Lord God Almighty, who hast built Thy
Church upon the foundation of the Apostles,
under Christ the head corner-stone, and to this
end didst endue Thy holy apostle St. Barnabas
with the singular gift of the Holy Ghost; leave me
not destitute, I humbly beseech Thee, of Thy
manifold gifts and talents, nor yet of grace to
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
make a right use of them always without any
sordid self-ends, to Thy honour and glory; that,
making a due improvement of all those gifts
Thou graciously entrustest me with, I may be
able to give a good account of my stewardship
when the great Judge shall appear, the Lord
Jesus Christ, who reigneth with Thee and the
Eternal Spirit, one God, blessed forever. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>

<h3>Prayer to the Teacher</h3>
<p>Be gracious, O Instructor, to us Thy children,
Father, Charioteer of Israel, Son and Father,
both in One, O Lord. Grant to us who
obey Thy precepts, that we may perfect the
likeness of the image, and with all our power
know Him who is the good God and not a
harsh judge. And do Thou Thyself cause that
all of us who have our conversation in Thy
peace, who have been translated into Thy
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
commonwealth, having sailed tranquilly over
the billows of sin, may be wafted in calm by
Thy Holy Spirit, by the ineffable wisdom, by
night and day to the perfect day; and giving
thanks may praise, and praising thank the
Alone Father and Son, Son and Father, the
Son, Instructor and Teacher, with the Holy
Spirit, all in One, in whom is all, for whom
all is One, for whom is eternity, whose members
we all are, whose glory the aeons are; for
the All-good, All-lovely, All-wise, All-just One.
To whom be glory both now and forever.
<span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Clement of Alexandria.</span></p>
<h3>For Growth in Grace</h3>
<p>Give perfection to beginners, O Father; give
intelligence to the little ones; give aid to those
who are running their course. Give sorrow to
the negligent; give fervour of spirit to the lukewarm.
Give to the perfect a good consummation;
for the sake of Christ Jesus our Lord.

shielded, rescued, helped, and guided us all
the days of our lives, and brought us unto
this hour. We pray and beseech Thee, merciful
God, to grant in Thy goodness that we may
spend this day, and all the time of our lives,
without sin, in fullness of joy, holiness, and
reverence of Thee. But drive away from us,
O Lord, all envy, all fear, and all temptations.
Bestow upon us what is good and meet. Whatever
sin we commit in thought, word, or deed,
do Thou in Thy goodness and mercy be pleased
to pardon. And lead us not into temptation, but
deliver us from evil; through the grace, mercy,
and love of Thine only begotten Son. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Liturgy of St. Mark.</span></p>
<h3>Thanksgiving and Prayer for Pardon</h3>
<p>We render unto Thee our thanksgiving, O
Lord our God, Father of our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ, by all means, at all times, in all
places. For that Thou hast sheltered, assisted,
supported, and led us on through the time
past of our life, and brought us to this hour.
And we pray and beseech Thee, O God and
loving Lord, grant us to pass this day, this
year, and all the time of our life without sin,
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
with all joy, health, and salvation. But all envy,
all fear, all temptation, all the working of
Satan, do Thou drive away, O God, from us,
and from Thy holy Church. Supply us with
things good and profitable. Whereinsoever we
have sinned against Thee, in word, or deed,
or thought, be Thou pleased in Thy love and
goodness to forgive, and forsake us not, O God,
who hope in Thee, neither lead us into temptation,
but deliver us from the evil one and from
his works; by the grace and compassion of
Thine only begotten Son, Jesus Christ. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Liturgy of St. Mark.</span></p>
<h3>For Friends and Relations</h3>
<p>Have mercy, O Lord, upon all those whom
Thou hast associated with us in the bonds of
friendship and kindredship, and grant that they,
with us, may be so perfectly conformed to Thy
Holy Will, that being cleansed from all sin,
we may be found worthy, by the inspiration of
Thy love, to be partakers together of the blessedness
of Thy heavenly kingdom; through Jesus
Christ our Lord. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Old Gallican Sacramentary.</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h3>For Christian Graces</h3>
<p>Grant Thy servants, O God, to be set on fire
with Thy Spirit, strengthened by Thy power, illuminated
by Thy splendour, filled with Thy
grace, and to go forward by Thine aid. Give
them, O Lord, a right faith, perfect love, true
humility. Grant, O Lord, that there may be in
us simple affection, brave patience, persevering
obedience, perpetual peace, a pure mind, a right
and honest heart, a good will, a holy conscience,
spiritual strength, a life unspotted and unblamable;
and after having manfully finished our
course, may we be enabled happily to enter
into Thy kingdom; through Jesus Christ our
Lord. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Old Gallican Sacramentary.</span></p>
<h3>A Table Grace</h3>
<p>Abba, Father, fulfill the office of Thy Name
towards Thy servants; do Thou govern, protect,
preserve, sanctify, guide, and console us.
Let us be so enkindled with love for Thee, that
we may not be despised by Thee, O most merciful
Lord, most tender Father; for Jesus Christ&rsquo;s
sake. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Old Gallican Sacramentary.</span></p>
<h3>Morning Prayer</h3>
<p>We give thee hearty thanks for the rest of
the past night, and for the gift of a new day,
with its opportunities of pleasing thee. Grant
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
that we may so pass its hours in the perfect freedom
of thy service, that at eventide we may
again give thanks unto thee; through Jesus
Christ our Lord. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;The Eastern Church.</span></p>
<h3>A Table Grace</h3>
<p>In the evening and morning and noonday we
praise Thee, we thank Thee, and pray Thee,
Master of all, to direct our prayers as incense
before Thee. Let not our hearts turn away to
words or thoughts of wickedness, but keep us
from all things that might hurt us; for to
Thee, O Lord, our eyes look up, and our hope
is in Thee: confound us not, O our God; for
the sake of Jesus Christ our Lord. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Eastern Church Vespers.</span></p>
<h3>For Ministers</h3>
<p>O God, great in power, unsearchable in understanding,
wondrous in counsels towards the
children of men, do Thou fill with the gift of
Thy Holy Spirit those whom Thou dost will
to undertake the degree of the priesthood that
they may be worthy to stand before Thy holy
altar unblamably, to announce the Gospel of
Thy kingdom, to administer the Word of Thy
Truth, to offer gifts and spiritual sacrifices unto
Thee, and to renew Thy people in the laver
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
of regeneration; that at the second coming of
our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ, Thine
only begotten Son, they may go forth to meet
Him, and by the multitude of Thy mercies receive
their reward; for Thy venerable and majestic
Name is blessed and glorified. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Eastern Church Liturgy.</span></p>
<h3>For Illumination</h3>
<p>Shine into our hearts, O loving Master, by
the pure light of the knowledge of Thyself,
and open the eyes of our mind to the contemplation
of Thy teaching, and put into us the fear of
Thy blessed commandments; that trampling
down all that is worldly, we may follow a
spiritual life, thinking and doing all things
according to Thy good pleasure. For Thou art
our sanctification, and our illumination, and to
Thee we render glory, Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages.
<span class="sc">Amen.</span>

<br />FOURTH CENTURY PRAYERS</h2>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<h3>For Charity</h3>
<p>O God of love, Who hast given a new commandment
through Thine only begotten Son,
that we should love one another, even as Thou
didst love us, the unworthy and the wandering,
and gavest Thy beloved Son for our life
and salvation; we pray Thee, Lord, give to us,
Thy servants, in all time of our life on the
earth, a mind forgetful of past ill-will, a pure
conscience and sincere thoughts, and a heart
to love our brethren; for the sake of Jesus Christ,
Thy Son, our Lord and only Saviour. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Coptic Liturgy of St. Cyril.</span></p>
<h3>For Protection</h3>
<p>Be gracious to our prayers, O merciful God,
and guard Thy people with loving protection;
that they who confess Thine only begotten Son
as God, born in our bodily flesh, may never be
corrupted by the deceits of the devil; through
the same Jesus Christ our Lord. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Ambrose.</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<h3>For Pardon</h3>
<p>O Lord, who hast mercy upon all, take away
from me my sins, and mercifully kindle in me
the fire of Thy Holy Spirit. Take away from
me the heart of stone, and give me a heart of
flesh, a heart to love and adore Thee, a heart to
delight in Thee, to follow and to enjoy Thee,
for Christ&rsquo;s sake. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Ambrose.</span></p>
<h3>For Trust and Fuller Knowledge</h3>
<p>Merciful Lord, the Comforter and Teacher
of Thy faithful people, increase in Thy Church
the desires which Thou hast given, and confirm
the hearts of those who hope in Thee by enabling
them to understand the depth of Thy promises,
that all Thine adopted sons may even now behold,
with the eyes of faith, and patiently wait for,
the light which as yet Thou dost not openly
manifest; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Ambrose.</span></p>
<h3>For Salvation</h3>
<p>O God, Who didst look on man when he
had fallen down into death, and resolve to redeem
him by the advent of Thine only begotten
Son; grant, we beseech Thee, that they
who confess His glorious Incarnation may also
be admitted to the fellowship of Him their Redeemer;
through the same Jesus Christ our
Lord. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Ambrose.</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<h3>For Freedom From Sin</h3>
<p>O Lord, my Saviour, in whose power it is to
remit sins, I beseech Thee say unto me, &ldquo;Loose
thee from thy chains, come out of the bonds
of thy sins&rdquo;; and when Thou sayest it, loose
those cords of my errors wherewith I am entangled
and bound; for, though I am the most
wicked of all men, and to be abhorred by reason
of my continuance in sins, yet when thou commandest,
I shall be free from them. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Ambrose.</span></p>
<h3>For Pardon</h3>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, who didst stretch out Thine
hands on the Cross, and redeem us by Thy
Blood, forgive me, a sinner, for none of my
thoughts are hid from Thee. Pardon I ask, pardon
I hope for, pardon I trust to have. Thou
who art pitiful and merciful, spare and forgive
me. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Ambrose.</span></p>
<h3>For Purity</h3>
<p>O Holy Spirit of God, very God, Who didst
descend upon Christ at the River Jordan, and
upon the Apostles in the upper chamber, we
have sinned against heaven and before Thee;
purify us again, we beseech Thee, with Thy
Divine fire, and have mercy upon us; for
Christ&rsquo;s sake. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Nerses of Clajes.</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>
<p>O Thou that beholdest all things, we have
sinned against Thee in thought, word, and deed;
blot out our transgressions, be merciful to us
sinners, and grant that our names may be
found written in the book of life, for the sake
of Christ Jesus our Saviour. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Nerses of Clajes.</span></p>
<h3>For Protection</h3>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, Keeper and Preserver of
all things, let Thy right hand guard us by day
and by night, when we sit at home, and when
we walk abroad, when we lie down and when
we rise up, that we may be kept from all evil,
and have mercy upon us sinners. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Nerses of Clajes.</span></p>
<h3>A Prayer for Spiritual Blessings</h3>
<p>Most high God, our loving Father, infinite in
majesty, we humbly beseech Thee for all Thy
servants everywhere, that Thou wouldst give us
a pure mind, perfect love, sincerity in conduct,
purity in heart, strength in action, courage in
distress, self-command in character. May our
prayers ascend to Thy gracious ears, and Thy
loving benediction descend upon us all, that
we may in all things be protected under the
shadow of Thy wings. Grant us pardon of our
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
sins; perfect our work; accept our prayers; protect
us by Thine own Name, O God of Jacob;
send us Thy saving help from Thy holy place,
and strengthen us out of Zion. Remember all
Thy people everywhere, give us all the grace
of devotion to Thy will; fulfill our desires with
good gifts, and crown us with Thy mercy.
When we serve Thee with faithful devotion,
pardon our sins and correct us with Fatherly
tenderness. Grant that, being delivered from
all adversity, and both here and eternally justified,
we may praise Thee forever and ever,
saying Holy, Holy, Holy; through Jesus Christ
our Lord and Saviour, Who with Thee and
the Holy Ghost, liveth and reigneth, ever one
God, world without end. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Gallican Sacramentary.</span></p>
<h3>For Those Gathered in Worship</h3>
<p>O Lord God, Who hast taught us to pray all
together, and hast promised to hear the united
voices of two or three invoking Thy Name;
hear now, O Lord, the prayers of Thy servants
unto their salvation, and give us in this world
knowledge of Thy Truth, and in the world to
come life everlasting; for the sake of Jesus
Christ our Lord. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Armenian Liturgy.</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<h3>For Right Blessings</h3>
<p>O Lord our God, teach us, we beseech Thee,
to ask Thee aright for the right blessings. Steer
Thou the vessel of our life toward Thyself, Thou
tranquil Haven of all storm-tossed souls. Show
us the course wherein we should go. Renew a
willing spirit within us. Let Thy Spirit curb
our wayward senses, and guide and enable us
unto that which is our true good, to keep Thy
laws, and in all our works evermore to rejoice
in Thy glorious and gladdening Presence. For
Thine is the glory and praise from all Thy
saints forever and ever. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Basil.</span></p>
<h3>For Converts in Mission Fields</h3>
<p>Remember, O Lord, all who in heathen lands
are under instruction for Holy Baptism; have
mercy upon them and confirm them in the
faith; remove all the remains of idolatry and
superstition from their hearts, that being devoted
to Thy law, Thy precepts, Thy fear, Thy
truths, and Thy commandments, they may grow
to a firm knowledge of the word in which they
have been instructed, and may be found worthy
to be made an habitation of the Holy Ghost,
by the laver of regeneration, for the remission
of their sins, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
<span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Basil.</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<h3>For Light and Guidance</h3>
<p>Eternal God, Thou uncreate and primal Light,
Maker of all created things, Fountain of pity,
Thou Sea of Bounty, fathomless deep of Loving-Kindness:
lift Thou up the light of Thy
countenance upon us! Lord, shine in our hearts,
true Sun of Righteousness, and fill our souls
with Thy beauty.</p>
<p>Teach us always to keep in mind Thy judgments,
and to discourse of them, and own Thee
continually as our Lord and Friend. Govern by
Thy will the works of our hands; and lead us in
the right way, that we may do what is well-pleasing
and acceptable to Thee, that through
us unworthy Thy holy name may be glorified.</p>
<p>To Thee alone be praise and honor and
worship eternally. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Basil.</span></p>
<h3>For Two or Three</h3>
<p>Almighty God, who hast given us grace at
this time to make our common supplications unto
Thee; and dost promise that when two or
three are gathered together in Thy name Thou
wilt grant their requests: fulfill now, O Lord,
the desires and petitions of Thy servants, as may
be most expedient for them, granting us in this
world knowledge of Thy truth, and in the
world to come, life everlasting. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Chrysostom.</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h3>For All People</h3>
<p>Remember, O Lord, this city wherein we
dwell and every other city and country, and all
the faithful who dwell in them. Remember, O
Lord, all who travel by land or water, all that
labour under sickness or slavery; remember
them for health and safety. Remember, O Lord,
those in Thy Holy Church who bring forth
good fruit, are rich in good works and forget
not the poor. Grant unto us all Thy mercy and
loving-kindness, and grant that we may with
one mouth and one heart praise and glorify Thy
great and glorious name, Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, now, henceforth, and forever.
<span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Chrysostom.</span></p>
<h3>Invocation</h3>
<p>Lord God, of might inconceivable, of glory
incomprehensible, of mercy immeasurable, of
benignity ineffable; do Thou, O Master, look
down upon us in Thy tender love, and show
forth, towards us and those who pray with us,
Thy rich mercies and compassions. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Liturgy of St. Chrysostom.</span></p>
<h3>For Refreshment</h3>
<p>O Lord our God, under the shadow of Thy
wings let us hope. Thou wilt support us, both
when little, and even to gray hairs. When our
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
strength is of Thee, it is strength; but, when
our own, it is feebleness. We return unto Thee,
O Lord, that from their weariness our souls may
rise towards Thee, leaning on the things which
Thou hast created, and passing on to Thyself,
who hast wonderfully made them; for with
Thee is refreshment and true strength. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<h3>Adoration</h3>
<p>O Thou Good Omnipotent, Who so carest
for every one of us, as if Thou caredst for him
alone; and so for all, as if all were but one!
Blessed is the man who loveth Thee, and his
friend in Thee, and his enemy for Thee. For
he only loses none dear to him, to whom all
are dear in Him who cannot be lost. And who
is that but our God, the God that made heaven
and earth, and filleth them, even by filling them
creating them. And Thy law is truth, and
truth is Thyself. I behold how some things
pass away that others may replace them, but
Thou dost never depart, O God, my Father
supremely good, Beauty of all things beautiful.
To Thee will I intrust whatsoever I have received
from Thee, so shall I lose nothing. Thou
madest me for Thyself, and my heart is restless
until it repose in Thee. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<h3>The Holy Spirit</h3>
<p>O holy Spirit, Love of God, infuse Thy grace,
and descend plentifully into my heart; enlighten
the dark corners of this neglected dwelling, and
scatter there Thy cheerful beams; dwell in that
soul that longs to be Thy temple; water that
barren soil, over-run with weeds and briars, and
lost for want of cultivating, and make it fruitful
with Thy dew from heaven. Oh come, Thou
refreshment of them that languish and faint.
Come, Thou Star and Guide of them that sail
in the tempestuous sea of the world; Thou only
Haven of the tossed and shipwrecked. Come,
Thou Glory and Crown of the living, and only
Safeguard of the dying. Come, Holy Spirit, in
much mercy, and make me fit to receive Thee.
<span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<h3>For Entire Love</h3>
<p>O Lord, my God, Light of the blind and
Strength of the weak; yea, also, Light of those
that see, and Strength of the strong; hearken
unto my soul, and hear it crying out of the
depths.</p>
<p>O Lord, help us to turn and seek Thee;
for Thou hast not forsaken Thy creatures as
we have forsaken Thee, our Creator. Let us
turn and seek Thee, for we know Thou art here
in our hearts, when we confess to Thee, when
we cast ourselves upon Thee, and weep in
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
Thy bosom, after all our rugged ways; and
Thou dost gently wipe away our tears, and
we weep the more for joy; because Thou, Lord,
who madest us dost remake and comfort us.</p>
<p>Hear, Lord, my prayer, and grant that I
may most entirely love Thee, and do Thou
rescue me, O Lord, from every temptation, even
unto the end. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<h3>For Steadfastness</h3>
<p>O God, the light of every heart that sees
Thee, the Life of every soul that loves Thee,
the strength of every mind that seeks Thee,
grant me ever to continue steadfast in Thy holy
love. Be Thou the joy of my heart; take it all
to Thyself, and therein abide. The house of
my soul is, I confess, too narrow for Thee; do
thou enlarge it, that Thou mayest enter in;
it is ruinous, but do Thou repair it. It has that
within which must offend Thine eyes; I confess
and know it; but whose help shall I implore
in cleansing it, but Thine alone? To Thee,
therefore, I cry urgently, begging that Thou
wilt cleanse me from my secret faults, and keep
Thy servant from presumptuous sins, that they
never get dominion over me. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<h3>For Perseverance</h3>
<p>I know, O Lord, and do with all humility
acknowledge myself an object altogether unworthy
of Thy love; but sure I am, Thou art an
object altogether worthy of mine. I am not
good enough to serve Thee, but Thou hast a
right to the best service I can pay. Do Thou
then impart to me some of that excellence, and
that shall supply my own want of worth. Help
me to cease from sin according to Thy will, that
I may be capable of doing Thee service according
to my duty. Enable me so to guard
and govern myself, so to begin and finish my
course, that, when the race of life is run, I may
sleep in peace, and rest in Thee. Be with me
unto the end, that my sleep may be rest indeed,
my rest perfect security, and that security a
blessed eternity. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<h3>For Mercy</h3>
<p>Come, O Lord, in much mercy down into
my soul, and take possession and dwell there.
A homely mansion, I confess, for so glorious a
Majesty, but such as Thou art fitting up for
the reception of Thee, by holy and fervent
desires of Thine own inspiring. Enter then,
and adorn, and make it such as Thou canst inhabit,
since it is the work of Thy hands. Give
me Thine own self, without which, though
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
Thou shouldst give me all that ever Thou hast
made, yet could not my desires be satisfied. Let
my soul ever seek Thee, and let me persist in
seeking, till I have found, and am in full possession
of Thee. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<h3>Refuge and Peace</h3>
<p>O Thou full of compassion, I commit and
commend myself unto Thee, in whom I am,
and live, and know. Be Thou the Goal of my
pilgrimage, and my Rest by the way. Let my
soul take refuge from the crowding turmoil
of worldly thoughts beneath the shadow of Thy
wings; let my heart, this sea of restless waves,
find peace in Thee, O God. Thou bounteous
Giver of all good gifts, give to him who is
weary refreshing food; gather our distracted
thoughts and powers into harmony again; and
set the prisoner free. See, he stands at thy door
and knocks; be it open to him, that he may
enter with a free step, and be quickened by
Thee. For Thou art the Well-spring of Life,
the Light of eternal Brightness, wherein the
just live who love Thee. Be it unto me according
to Thy word. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<h3>Perfect Love</h3>
<p>Grant me, even me, my dearest Lord, to
know Thee, and love Thee, and rejoice in Thee.
And, if I cannot do these perfectly in this life,
let me at least advance to higher degrees every
day, till I can come to do them in perfection.
Let the knowledge of Thee increase in me
here, that it may be full hereafter. Let the love
of Thee grow every day more and more here,
that it may be perfect hereafter; that my joy may
be great in itself, and full in Thee. I know, O
God, that Thou art a God of truth, O make good
Thy gracious promises to me, that my joy may
be full. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<h3>For Perfect Light</h3>
<p>O Thou holy and unspeakable, Thou wonderful
and mighty God, whose power and wisdom
hath no end, before whom all powers
tremble, at whose glance the heavens and the
earth flee away, Thou art Love, Thou art my
Father, and I will love and worship Thee forever
and ever!</p>
<p>Thou hast deigned to show pity on me, and
a ray from Thy light hath shone upon mine
inward eye. Guide me on into the perfect light,
that it may illumine me wholly, and that all
darkness may flee away. Let the holy flame of
Thy love so burn in my heart that it be made
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
pure, and I may see Thee, O God; for it is
the pure in heart who see Thee. Thou hast set
me free; Thou hast drawn me to Thee; therefore
forsake me not, but keep me always in
Thy grace. Guide me, and rule me, and perfect
me for Thy kingdom. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<h3>For More Love</h3>
<p>Thee, most merciful God, do I now invoke
to descend into my soul, which Thou hast prepared
for Thy reception by the desire which
Thou hast breathed into it. Ere ever I cried to
Thee, Thou, most Merciful, hadst called and
sought me, that I might find Thee, and finding
love Thee. Even so I sought and found Thee,
Lord, and desire to love Thee. Increase my desire,
and grant me what I ask. See, I love Thee,
but too little; strengthen my love. When my
spirit aspires to Thee, and meditates on Thine
unspeakable goodness, the burden of the flesh
becomes less heavy, the tumult of thought is
stilled, the weight of mortality is less oppressive.
Then fain would my soul find wings,
that she might rise in tireless flight ever upwards
to Thy glorious throne, and there be
filled with the refreshing solace that belongs
to the citizens of heaven. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<h3>For Mercy and Grace</h3>
<p>O God, our true Life, in whom and by whom
all things live, Thou commandest us to seek
Thee, and art ready to be found; Thou biddest
us knock, and openest when we do so. To know
Thee is life, to serve Thee is freedom, to enjoy
Thee is a kingdom, to praise Thee is the joy
and happiness of the soul. I praise, and bless,
and adore Thee, I worship Thee, I glorify Thee,
I give thanks to Thee for Thy great glory. I
humbly beseech Thee to abide with me, to
reign in me, to make this heart of mine a holy
temple, a fit habitation for Thy Divine majesty.
O Thou Maker and Preserver of all things,
visible and invisible! keep, I beseech Thee,
the work of Thine own hands, who trusts in
Thy mercy alone for safety and protection.
Guard me with the power of Thy grace, here
and in all places, now and at all times, forevermore.
<span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<h3>For a Safe Voyage</h3>
<p>Blessed are all Thy saints, my God and King,
who have travelled over the tempestuous sea
of mortality, and have at last made the desired
port of peace and felicity. Oh, cast a gracious
eye upon us who are still in our dangerous
voyage. Remember and succor us in our distress,
and think on them that lie exposed to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
rough storms of troubles and temptations.
Strengthen our weakness, that we may do
valiantly in this spiritual war; help us against our
own negligence and cowardice, and defend us
from the treachery of our unfaithful hearts.
We are exceeding frail, and indisposed to every
virtuous and gallant undertaking. Grant, O
Lord, that we may bring our vessel safe to
shore, unto our desired haven. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<h3>For Perfect Love</h3>
<p>Look upon us, O Lord, and let all the darkness
of our souls vanish before the beams of
Thy brightness. Fill us with holy love, and
open to us the treasures of Thy wisdom. All
our desire is known unto Thee, therefore perfect
what Thou hast begun, and what Thy
Spirit has awakened us to ask in prayer. We
seek Thy face, turn Thy face unto us and show
us Thy Glory. Then shall our longing be
satisfied, and our peace shall be perfect. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<h3>For Obedience and Love</h3>
<p>Thou, O Lord, who commandest me to ask,
grant that I may receive; Thou hast put me
upon seeking, let me be happy in finding;
Thou hast bidden me knock, I pray Thee open
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
unto me. Be graciously pleased to direct and
govern all my thoughts and actions, that, for
the future, I may serve Thee, and entirely devote
myself to obeying Thee. Accept me, I beseech
Thee, and draw me to Thyself, that I
may henceforth be Thine by obedience and love,
who am already all Thine own, as Thy creature.
Even Thine, O Lord, who livest and reignest
forever and ever. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<h3>For Light</h3>
<p>O God our Father, who dost exhort us to
pray, and who dost grant what we ask, if only,
when we ask, we live a better life; hear me,
who am trembling in this darkness, and stretch
forth Thy hand unto me; hold forth Thy light
before me; recall me from my wanderings; and,
Thou being my Guide, may I be restored to
myself and to Thee, through Jesus Christ.
<span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<h3>For Illumination</h3>
<p>Late have I loved Thee, O Thou Eternal
Truth and Goodness: late have I sought Thee,
my Father! But Thou didst seek me, and when
Thou shinedst forth upon me, then I knew Thee
and learnt to love Thee. I thank Thee, O my
Light, that Thou didst thus shine upon me;
that Thou didst teach my soul what Thou
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
wouldst be to me, and didst incline Thy face
in pity unto me. Thou, Lord, hast become my
Hope, my Comfort, my Strength, my All! In
Thee doth my soul rejoice. The darkness vanished
from before mine eyes, and I beheld Thee,
the Son of Righteousness. When I loved darkness,
I knew Thee not, but wandered on from
night to night. But Thou didst lead me out of
that blindness; Thou didst take me by the
hand and call me to Thee, and now I can thank
Thee, and Thy mighty voice which hath penetrated
to my inmost heart. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<h3>Obligation to Others</h3>
<p>O Lord, our Saviour, who hast warned us
that thou wilt require much of those to whom
much is given; grant that we whose lot is cast
in so goodly a heritage may strive together the
more abundantly to extend to others what we
so richly enjoy; and as we have entered into
the labours of other men, so to labour that
in their turn other men may enter into ours, to
the fulfillment of Thy holy will; through Jesus
Christ our Lord. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<h3>For Refreshment</h3>
<p>O Holy Spirit, Love of God, infuse Thy
grace, and descend plentifully into my heart;
enlighten the dark corners of this neglected
dwelling, and scatter there Thy cheerful beams;
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
dwell in that soul that longs to be Thy temple;
water that barren soil, over-run with weeds and
briars, and lost for want of cultivating, and
make it fruitful with Thy dew from heaven.
Oh come, Thou refreshment of them that languish
and faint. Come, Thou Star and Guide
of them that sail in the tempestuous sea of the
world; Thou only Haven of the tossed and
ship-wrecked. Come, Thou Glory and Crown
of the living, and only Safeguard of the dying.
Come, Holy Spirit, in much mercy, and make
me fit to receive Thee. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<h3>For Increased Godly Knowledge</h3>
<p>Grant us, even us, O Lord, to know Thee,
and love Thee, and rejoice in Thee. And if we
cannot do these perfectly in this life, let us, at
least, advance to higher degrees every day, till
we can come to do them in perfection. Let the
knowledge of Thee increase in us here, that it
may be full hereafter. Let the love of Thee grow
every day more and more here, that it may be
perfect hereafter; that our joy may be great in
itself and full in Thee. We know, O God, that
Thou art a God of truth, O make good Thy
gracious promises to us, that our joy may be full.
To Thine honour and glory, Who with the
Father and the Holy Ghost liveth and reigneth
one God, world without end. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<h3>Praise</h3>
<p>Great art Thou, O Lord, and greatly to be
praised; great is Thy power, and Thy wisdom is
infinite. Thee would we praise without ceasing.
Thou callest us to delight in Thy praise, for
Thou hast made us for Thyself, and our hearts
find no rest until we rest in Thee; Who with
the Father and the Holy Ghost all glory, praise,
and honour be ascribed, both now and forevermore.
<span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<h3>For Grace</h3>
<p>We ask not of Thee, O Father, silver and
gold, honour and glory, nor the pleasures of
the world, but do Thou grant us grace to seek
Thy Kingdom and Thy righteousness, and do
Thou add unto us things necessary for the
body and for this life. Behold, O Lord, our
desire; may it be pleasing in Thy sight. We
present our petition unto Thee through our
Lord Jesus Christ, Who is at Thy right hand,
our mediator and Advocate, through Whom
Thou soughtest us that we might seek Thee;
Thy Word, through Whom Thou madest us
and all things; Thy only begotten Son, through
Whom Thou callest us to adoption, Who intercedeth
with Thee for us, and in Whom
are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge;
to Him, with Thyself and the Holy Spirit,
be all honour, praise, and glory, now and forever.
<span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<h3>For Peace</h3>
<p>O Lord God, grant Thy peace to us, for Thou
hast supplied us with all things&mdash;the peace of
rest, the peace of the Sabbath, which hath no
evening; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<h3>Evening Prayer</h3>
<p>Watch Thou, dear Lord, with those who
wake, or watch, or weep to night, and give Thine
angels charge over those who sleep. Tend Thy
sick ones, O Lord Christ. Rest Thy weary ones.
Bless Thy dying ones. Soothe Thy suffering
ones. Pity Thine afflicted ones. Shield Thy
joyous ones. And all, for Thy Love&rsquo;s sake.
<span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<h3>For Perfection</h3>
<p>Hear, Lord, my prayer; let not my soul faint
under Thy discipline, nor let me faint in confessing
unto Thee all Thy mercies whereby
Thou hast drawn me out of all my most evil
ways, that Thou mightest become a delight to
me above all the allurements which I once
pursued; that I may most entirely love Thee,
and clasp Thy hand with all my affections, and
Thou mayest yet rescue me from every temptation,
even unto the end. For lo, O Lord, my
King and my God, for Thy service be whatever
useful thing my childhood learned; for Thy
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
service that I speak, write, read, reckon. For
Thou didst grant me Thy discipline while I
was learning vanities; and my sin of delighting
in those vanities Thou hast forgiven. In them,
indeed, I learnt many a useful word, but these
may as well be learned in things not vain; and
that is the safe path for the steps of youth. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<h3>For Light</h3>
<p>O let the Light, the Truth, the Light of my
heart, not mine own darkness, speak unto me.
I fell off into that, and became darkened; but
even thence, even thence I loved Thee. I went
astray, and remembered Thee. I heard Thy voice
behind me, calling me to return, and scarcely
heard it, through the tumultuousness of the
enemies of peace. And now, behold, I return
in distress and panting after Thy fountain. Let
no man forbid me! of this will I drink, and so
live. Let me not be mine own life; from myself
I lived ill, death was I to myself; and I revive
in Thee. Do Thou speak unto me, do Thou
discourse unto me. I have believed Thy Books,
and their words be most full of mystery. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<h3>Communion with God</h3>
<p>O how shall I call upon God, my God and
Lord, since, when I call for Him, I shall be
calling Him into myself? And what room is
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
there within me, whither my God can come
into me? Whither can God come into me, God
who made heaven and earth? Is there, indeed, O
Lord my God, aught in me that can contain
Thee? Do, then, heaven and earth, which Thou
hast made, and wherein Thou hast made me,
contain Thee? Or, because nothing which exists
could exist without Thee, doth therefore whatever
exists contain Thee? Since, then, I too exist,
why do I seek that Thou shouldest enter into
me, who were not, wert Thou not in me? Why?
Because I am not gone down in hell, and yet
Thou art there also. For if I go down into hell,
Thou art there. I could not be, then, O my God,
could not be at all, wert Thou not in me;
or rather, unless I were in Thee, of whom are
all things, by whom are all things, in whom
are all things! Even so, Lord, even so. Whither
do I call Thee, since I am in Thee? Or whence
canst Thou enter into me? For whither can I
go beyond heaven and earth, that thence my
God should come into me, who hath said, &ldquo;I
fill the heaven and the earth&rdquo;?</p>
<p>O God, the vessels which Thou fillest uphold
Thee not, since, though they were broken, Thou
wert not poured out, on us, Thou art not cast
down, but Thou upliftest us; Thou art not
dissipated, but Thou gatherest us.... <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<h3>Rest in Thee</h3>
<p>O Lord God, give peace unto us (for Thou
hast given us all things): the peace of rest, the
peace of the Sabbath, which hath no evening:
Yea, give us rest in Thee, the Sabbath of eternal
life. For Thou shalt rest in us, as now Thou
workest in us; and Thy rest shall be through
us, as Thy works are through us. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<h3>For Light</h3>
<p>O Lord, who art the Light, the Way, the
Truth, the Life; in whom there is no darkness,
error, vanity, or death&mdash;the Light without which
there is darkness; the Way without which there
is wandering; the Truth without which there
is error; the life without which there is Death;
say, Lord, let there be Light, and I shall see
Light, and eschew Darkness; I shall see the
way and avoid wandering; I shall see the Truth
and shun error; I shall see Life and escape
Death: Illuminate, O illuminate my blind soul
which sitteth in darkness and the shadow of
Death; and direct my feet into the way of
peace. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Augustine.</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<h3>A Morning Prayer</h3>
<p>O God, who art faithful and true, who &ldquo;hast
mercy on thousands and ten thousands of them
that love Thee,&rdquo; the lover of the humble, and
the protector of the needy, of whom all things
stand in need, for all things are subject to Thee;
look down upon this Thy people, who bow
down their heads to Thee, and bless them with
spiritual blessing. &ldquo;Keep them as the apple
of an eye,&rdquo; preserve them in piety and righteousness,
and vouchsafe them eternal life in
Christ Jesus Thy beloved Son, with whom glory,
honour, and worship be to Thee and to the
Holy Spirit, now and always, and forever and
ever. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Apostolic Constitutions.</span></p>
<h3>The Thanksgiving for the Morning</h3>
<p>O God, the God of spirits and of all flesh,
who art beyond compare, and standest in need
of nothing, who hast given the sun to have
rule over the day, and the moon and the stars
to have rule over the night, do Thou now also
look down upon us with gracious eyes, and receive
our morning thanksgivings, and have
mercy upon us; for we have not &ldquo;spread out
our hands unto a strange God;&rdquo; for there is
not among us any new God, but Thou, the
eternal God, who art without end, who hast
given us our being through Christ, and given
us our well-being through Him. Do Thou
vouchsafe us also, through Him, eternal life;
with whom glory, and honour, and worship be
to Thee and to the Holy Spirit forever. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>

<h3>A Morning Prayer</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Glory be to God in the highest, and upon
earth peace, good-will among men.&rdquo; We praise
Thee, we sing hymns to Thee, we bless Thee,
we glorify Thee, we worship Thee by Thy great
High Priest; Thee who art the true God, who
art the One Unbegotten, the only inaccessible
Being. For Thy great glory, O Lord and heavenly
King, O God the Father Almighty, O Lord
God, the Father of Christ the immaculate Lamb,
who taketh away the sin of the world, receive
our prayer, Thou that sittest upon the cherubim.
For Thou only art holy, Thou only art the
Lord Jesus, the Christ of the God of all created
nature, and our King, by whom glory, honour,
and worship be to Thee. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>

<h3>An Evening Prayer</h3>
<p>Save us, O God, and raise us up by Thy
Christ. Let us stand up, and beg for the mercies
of the Lord, and His compassions, for the angel
of peace, for what things are good and profitable,
for a Christian departure out of this life, an
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
evening and a night of peace, and free from
sin; and let us beg that the whole course of
our life may be unblamable. Let us dedicate
ourselves and one another to the living God
through His Christ. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>

<h3>An Evening Prayer</h3>
<p>O God, who art without beginning and without
end, the Maker of the whole world by
Christ, and the Provider for it, but before all
His God and Father, the Lord of the Spirit, and
the King of intelligible and sensible beings;
who hast made the day for the works of light,
and the night for the refreshment of our infirmity,&mdash;for
&ldquo;the day is Thine, the night also
is Thine: Thou hast prepared the light and
the sun,&rdquo;&mdash;do Thou now, O Lord, Thou lover
of mankind, and Fountain of all good, mercifully
accept of this our evening thanksgiving. Thou
who hast brought us through the length of the
day, and hast brought us to the beginnings of
the night, preserve us by Thy Christ, afford us
a peaceable evening, and a night free from
sin, and vouchsafe us everlasting life by Thy
Christ, through whom glory, honour, and
worship be to Thee in the Holy Spirit forever.

<h3>An Evening Prayer</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Ye children, praise the Lord: Praise the name
of the Lord.&rdquo; We praise Thee, we sing hymns
to Thee, we bless Thee for Thy great glory,
O Lord our King, the Father of Christ the immaculate
Lamb, who taketh away the sin of
the world. Praise becomes Thee, hymns become
Thee, glory becomes Thee, the God and Father,
through the Son, in the most holy Spirit, forever
and ever. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>

<h3>Table Grace</h3>
<p>Thou art blessed, O Lord, who nourishest
me from my youth, who givest food to all
flesh. Fill our hearts with joy and gladness,

we may abound to every good work, in Christ
Jesus our Lord, through whom glory, honour,
and power be to Thee forever. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>

<h3>For the First-Fruits</h3>
<p>We give thanks to Thee, O Lord Almighty,
the Creator of the whole world, and its Preserver,
through Thy only begotten Son Jesus
Christ our Lord, for the first-fruits which are
offered to Thee, not in such a manner as we
ought, but as we are able. For what man is
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
there that can worthily give Thee thanks for
those things Thou hast given them to partake
of? The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and
of Jacob, and of all the saints, who madest all
things fruitful by Thy word, and didst command
the earth to bring forth various fruits for our
rejoicing and our food; who hast given to the
duller and more sheepish sort of creatures juices&mdash;herbs
to them that feed on herbs, and to some
flesh, to others seeds, but to us corn, as advantageous
and proper food, and many other things&mdash;some
for our necessities, some for our health,
and some for our pleasure. On all these accounts,
therefore, art Thou worthy of exalted hymns of
praise for Thy beneficence by Christ, through
whom glory, honour, and worship be to Thee,
in the Holy Spirit, forever. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Apostolic Constitutions.</span></p>
<h3>Thanks For Thy Mercies</h3>
<p>We give Thee thanks for all things, O Lord
Almighty, that Thou hast not taken away Thy
mercies and Thy compassions from us; but in
every succeeding generation Thou dost save,
and deliver, and assist, and protect: for Thou
didst assist in the days of Enos and Enoch, in
the days of Moses and Joshua, in the days of
the judges, in the days of Samuel and of
Elijah and of the prophets, in the days of David
and of the kings, in the days of Esther and
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
Mordecai, and in our days hast Thou assisted us
by Thy great High Priest, Jesus Christ Thy
Son. For He has delivered us from the sword,
and hath freed us from famine, and sustained
us; has delivered us from sickness, has preserved
us from an evil tongue. For all which
things do we give Thee thanks through Christ,
who has given us an articulate voice to confess
withal, and added to it a suitable tongue as an
instrument to modulate withal, and a proper
taste, and a suitable touch, and a sight for contemplation,
and the hearing of sounds, and the
smelling of vapours, and hands for work, and
feet for walking. Thou hast instructed [man] by
Thy laws, improved him by Thy statutes; and
when Thou bringest on a dissolution for a
while, Thou hast promised a resurrection.
Wherefore what life is sufficient, what length
of ages will be long enough, for men to be
thankful? To do it worthily it is impossible, but
to do it according to our ability is just and
right. Thou hast delivered us from error and
ignorance; Thou hast sent Christ among men
as a man, being the only begotten God; Thou
hast made the Comforter to inhabit among us;
Thou hast set angels over us; Thou hast put
the devil to shame; Thou hast brought us into
being when we were not; Thou takest care of us
when made; Thou measurest out life to us; Thou
affordest us food; Thou hast promised repentance.
Glory and worship be to Thee for all
these things, through Jesus Christ, now and
ever, and through all ages. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>

<h3>For The Holy Spirit</h3>
<p>O God Almighty, the Father of Thy Christ,
Thy only begotten Son, give me a body undefiled,
a heart pure, a mind watchful, an unerring
knowledge, the influence of the Holy
Ghost for the obtaining and assured enjoying of
the truth, through Thy Christ, by whom glory
be to Thee, in the Holy Spirit, for ever. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>

<h3>For the Faithful</h3>
<p>O Lord Almighty, the Most High, who dwellest
on high, the Holy One, that restest among
the saints, without beginning, the Only Potentate,
who hast given to us by Christ the preaching
of knowledge, to the acknowledgment of
Thy glory and of Thy name, which He has
made known to us, for our comprehension, do
Thou now also look down through Him upon
this Thy flock, and deliver it from all ignorance
and wicked practice, and grant that we may
fear Thee in earnest, and love Thee with affection,
and have a due reverence of Thy glory.
Be gracious and merciful to them, and hearken
to them when they pray unto Thee; and keep
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
them, that they may be unmoveable, unblameable,
and unreprovable, that they may be holy
in body and spirit, not having spot or wrinkle,
or any such thing; but that they may be complete,
and none of them may be defective or
imperfect. O our support, our powerful God,
who dost not accept persons, be Thou the assister
of this Thy people, which Thou hast redeemed
with the precious blood of Thy Christ;
be Thou their protector, aider, provider, and
guardian, their strong wall of defence, their
bulwark and security. For &ldquo;none can snatch out
of Thy hand:&rdquo; for there is no other God like
Thee; for on Thee is our reliance. &ldquo;Sanctify
them by Thy truth: for Thy word is truth.&rdquo;

<h3>On the Lord&rsquo;s Day</h3>
<p>O Lord Almighty, Thou hast created the
world by Christ, and hast appointed the Sabbath
in memory thereof, because that on that day
Thou hast made us rest from our works, for
the meditation upon Thy laws. Thou hast also
appointed festivals for the rejoicing of our souls,
that we might come into the remembrance of
that wisdom which was created by Thee; how
He submitted to be made of a woman on our
account; He appeared in life, and demonstrated
Himself in His baptism; how he that appeared
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
is both God and man; He suffered for us by
Thy permission, and died, and rose again by
Thy power: on which account we solemnly assemble
to celebrate the feast of the resurrection
on the Lord&rsquo;s day, and rejoice on account of
Him who has conquered death, and hast brought
life and immortality to light. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Apostolic Constitutions.</span></p>
<h3>For the Holy Communion</h3>
<p>We thank Thee, our Father, for that life
which Thou hast made known to us by Jesus
Thy Son, by whom madest all things, and takest
care of the whole world; whom Thou hast sent
to become man for our salvation; whom Thou
hast permitted to suffer and to die; whom Thou
hast raised up, and been pleased to glorify, and
hast set Him down on Thy right hand; by
whom Thou hast promised us the resurrection
of the dead. Do Thou, O Lord Almighty, everlasting
God, so gather together Thy Church
from the ends of the earth into Thy kingdom,
as this corn was once scattered, and is now become
one loaf. We also, our Father, thank Thee
for the precious blood of Jesus Christ, which
was shed for us, and for His precious body,
whereof we celebrate this representation, as
Himself appointed us, &ldquo;to show forth His death.&rdquo;
For through Him glory is to be given to Thee
for ever. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>

<h3>After the Holy Communion</h3>
<p>We thank Thee, O God and Father of Jesus
our Saviour, for Thy holy name, which Thou
hast made to inhabit among us; and that knowledge,
faith, love, and immortality which Thou
hast given us through Thy Son Jesus. Thou,
O Almighty Lord, the God of the universe,
hast created the world, and the things that are
therein by Him; and hast planted a law in
our souls, and beforehand didst prepare things
for the convenience of men. O God of our holy
and blameless fathers, Abraham, and Isaac, and
Jacob, Thy faithful servants; Thou, O God,
who art powerful, faithful and true, and
without deceit in Thy promises; who didst send
upon earth Jesus Thy Christ to live with men,
as a man, when He was God the Word, and
man, to take away error by the roots: do Thou
even now, through Him, be mindful of this
Thy holy Church, which Thou hast purchased
with the precious blood of Thy Christ, and
deliver it from all evil, and perfect it in Thy
love and Thy truth, and gather us all together
into Thy kingdom which Thou hast prepared.
Let this Thy kingdom come. <span class="sc">Amen.</span>
